# Setup Nvim
> To run a command make sure you're in 'Normal' mode by pressing ESC, and then write the command. Typically something like **`:<command>`**


I started learning vim like 2 days ago so please if your name is Chad and you've been doing this since you slid out the womb, be gentle omg!

### ü§ó Getting Started
<hr>

**N.B. This walkthrough is assuming you already have nvim installed. If you don't then follow [these instructions](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/releases).**

1. Download the nvim folder and save in your `~/.config` folder.

2. `cd ~/.config`

3. Replace `mandy-cyber` with your name/username/whatever you want. You need to do this for:
    - The mandy-cyber folder in `nvim/lua`
    - Lines 1 and 2 of `nvim/lua/mandy-cyber/init.lua`
    - Line 1 of `nvim/init.lua`

<br>

4. Install packer.nvim by doing:
```shell
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/wbthomason/packer.nvim\
~/.local/share/nvim/site/pack/packer/start/packer.nvim
```

5. Go to `nvim/lua/packer.lua` and run the command `:so`
    - Check that a bunch of things are downloading correctly by then running the command `:PackerSync`


6. Not sure if this step is entirely necessary but just in case (idk) go in each of the files in `nvim/after/plugin` and run the `:so` command again. Should be pretty quick.


7. All done (hopefully lol)!

### ü§ñ Commands and Remaps
<hr>
Now, read through `commands.md` to see different commands you can run with the plugins you've installed as well as the remaps I made for some of them.

You can change the remaps in `nvim/lua/mandy-cyber/remap.lua` as well as in the individual plugin files in `nvim/after/plugin`.

Oh also note that the function in `colors.lua` is not from a plugin. It's just one I wrote.

AH one more thing, for basic vim settings and yada yada (like indent size and spell-checking) you can make changes in `nvim/lua/mandy-cyber/set.lua`

### ‚úèÔ∏è Useful Resources
<hr>

A big chunk of all this I got from watching [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7i4amO_zaE) youtube video by ThePrimeagen on 0.5x speed, and then added my own flava and whatnot. Other useful resources include:

üìΩÔ∏è [Vim Tutorial for Beginners](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ4p-saaQkc&t=2724s&pp=ygURdmltIGZvciBiZWdpbm5lcnM%3D) - i watched the first like 40 minutes to get a general understanding of the basics of vim and it was more than enough knowledge for me to follow along with the ThePrimeagen video.

üíñ [Vim cheatsheet](https://devhints.io/vim) - exactly what it sounds like

üé®[Vimcolorschemes](https://vimcolorschemes.com/) - for a gazillion other cool colorschemes you can download

ü•≥ [awesome-neovim](https://github.com/rockerBOO/awesome-neovim) - for a bunch of nvim plugin suggestions/recommendations

üíª [Neovim Options](https://neovim.io/doc/user/options.html) to see an overview of nvim options you can set (check `nvim/lua/mandy-cyber/set.lua`)
